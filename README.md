The language used in Unreal Engine is C++. The second method used is Blueprint visual scripting.  
The blueprint visual scripting system in Unreal Engine is a complex and a complete scripting system which is based on a concept of using a node-based workflow to create gameplay elements within the Unreal Engine editor. Much like other scripting languages, it uses object-oriented (OO) classes in the engine. The system is extremely accessible and powerful as it provides the full power of concepts and tools of programming which is essentially available to every kind of developer, from programmers to designers and artists. Unreal Engine also provides support to use both visual scripting as well as coding simultaneously to build game elements which is used in this project.
